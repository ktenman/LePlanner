  <h1>User manual</h1>
  <p>
  	User manual is a document, which shows the user's view on the system - 
  	what you can use it for, how to use it, what are the possible error situations,
  	and resolving them. User manual does not look the "insides" of the system, only what is visible to the user.
  	If necessary, installing manual can be added here too.

<h2>Regular (not logged in) visitor</h2>
<p>Not logged in user sees latest, alphabetical and oldest scenarios on the home page.
They can find scenarios by using the search, see scenarios created by other people and use the advanced search to get more specific results.
Users profile (who have logged in with Google at least once) are also publicly accessible. Unregistered users can't create
scenarios without a registered profile. If an unregistered user wants to create scenarios, they will receive a notification, which says that they need to log in.
